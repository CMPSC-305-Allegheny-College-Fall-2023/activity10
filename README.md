## Due: END OF CLASS

![bases](./graphics/usingmongosh.png)

Today, we went over the basics of the PyMongo library to be able to interact with a database using Python. In this activity, you will use your own words to explain the code we covered in class. Cool, right?

## Project Goals

* To determine new ways to use Python programming to manage database systems.
* To use the PyMongo library to interact with simple Mongodb data.
* To explain how the code works in terms of its interaction with library, the base and the data

## Instructions

Please address the TODO's in the file `writing/reflection.md`. You are to submit this work to your GitHub repository at least three (3) times. Please enter all code from class as your deliverable. Your instructor will have more information about this activity. Note: some of your code may require a database. In this case, please feel free to use the included builder file for the CampusDB

## Project Assessment

This is a check mark grade. Your work will be considered complete when you see the green check-mark at the top of the page of your GitHub repository.

## GatorGrade

You can check the baseline writing and commit requirements for this lab assignment by running the department's assignment checking `gatorgrade` tool. To use `gatorgrade`, you first need to make sure you have Python installed (type `python --version` to check). If you do not have Python installed, please see:

* [Setting Up Python on Windows](https://realpython.com/lessons/python-windows-setup/)
* [Python 3 Installation and Setup Guide](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)
* [How to Install Python 3 and Set Up a Local Programming Environment on Windows 10](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-python-3-and-set-up-a-local-programming-environment-on-windows-10)

Then, if you have not done so already, you need to install `gatorgrade`:

* First, [install `pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/installation/)
* Then, install `gatorgrade` with `pipx install gatorgrade`

Finally, you can run `gatorgrade`:

`gatorgrade --config config/gatorgrade.yml`

* [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
* Do not forget to use git commands to push your work to the cloud for the instructor to grade your assignment. You can go to your GitHub repository using your browser to verify that your files have been submitted. Please see the TLâ€™s or the instructor if you have any questions about assignment submission.

Students who have questions about this project outside of the lab time are invited
to ask them in the course's Discord channel or during instructor's or TL's office hours.
